When it comes to oracle VB networking, it support 7 networking mode.
1.Not Attached
2. NAT
3.Nat NetNetwork
4.Host only network
Internal Network
Bridge Network
Genric driver

But we need to write the vagrant networking configration in vagrant file, so that vagrant takes care of mapping this vagrant specific netwrking
mode in underlying hypervisor provider networking mode while provisining the VM, so that our machine configure will be provide accross all
hypervisor provider.

Vagrant support 3 types network mode.
1.forwarded_port-NAT with port forwarding-
during the developement of application developer can setup the server env to test his code, he has written by using virtualbox net network
so that VM can access external network.
2.Private Network-Internal Networking
All VM should connect to the same private network and can communicate to each other.But VM do't have the Host/external network vise varsa
to host/ext network can't access the vms'
3.Public network-Bridge Network- Bridge network in oracle VM, less secured, not used in production.We can allow the VM access from
anywhere.

How to configure these networking mode using vagrant?
syntex-
vagrant.configure(2) do | config |
config.vm.box = "boxname"
config.vm.synced folder "source","destination"
config.vm.network"networkmode"
end
